# CasinoOnline

Ideas
May want to look into Flask, Django, Websockets/socket.io for web setup and player to player communication.

Also look into frontend design and decide if you want to use a custom library set like BootStrap or build everything from scratch.


# Plan of Action 
1. Identify games to play 
    - Card
        - poker
        - blackjack 
        - go fish
    - Dice
        - liar's dice
 2. Identify the flow of the app. 
    - Choose the game
    - Play 
    - Choose to play again, or pick another game
    
3. For each game:
    - flow
    - win condition (when does the game end) (score, count of some sort)
    
4. In general,
    - Import the card library http://svg-cards.sourceforge.net/
    - Import the dice library https://game-icons.net/tags/dice.html
    
    
## Questions/Goals 
- How many players do we want? 
- Multi-device (server, website, __standalone__)
- Maybe publish to a website 

## Future Ideas
- login
- multiple players
- live server

## What file structure do we need?

Each game would its file, a main navigation file
